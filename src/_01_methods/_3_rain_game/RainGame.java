/*
 * Goal: Make a game where the user has to catch rain drops in a bucket!
 * 
 * In the setup() method:
 * 1. If you are using an image for the bucket, load it and resize it here.
 *    A bucket image, bucket.png, has been provided if you want to use it.
 *    bucket = loadImage("images/bucket.png");
 *    bucket.resize(100, 100);  // you can choose values other than 100, 100
 * 
 * In the draw() method:
 * 2. Set a background color
 * 
 * 3. Draw a raindrop (ellipse) at the top of the screen
 * 
 * 4. Make the rain fall down the screen.
 *    Hint: make a variable for the raindrop's Y position and change it after
 *    you draw the raindrop.
 * 
 * 5. When the rain falls off the bottom of the canvas, start a new rain drop
 *    falling from the top.
 *    Each new drop should start at a random position (X position) at the top.
 *    Hint: This code will get a random number between 0 and the window width.
 *    int randomNumber = (int)random(width);
 * 
 * 6. Draw a bucket (rectangle or image) at the bottom of the screen.
 *    The bucket's width needs to be stored in the bucketWidth variable.
 * 
 * 7. Make the bucket move side-to-side with the mouse. Hint: use mouseX
 * 
 * 8. When the rain drop has fallen to the bucket, call the checkCatch() method
 *    to see if the rain drop is in the bucket.
 * 
 * 9. Show the current score on the screen using the code below.
 *    Change the color if it does not show up on your background.
 *    fill(0, 0, 0);
 *    textSize(16);
 *    text("Score: " + score, 20, 20);
